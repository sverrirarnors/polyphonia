## Audition Process

Auditions typically take the form of a quartet evening. Together with the section leaders of the orchestra, you'll play excerpts from a previous program. This allows you to get a feel for playing together in the orchestra and get to know us.

**The string auditions for spring 2026 will be held on February 17th.**

### For Wind and Brass
For the wind audition, we will send you an excerpt (approx. 2–3 minutes) from a piece in our current program. In addition, we ask you to prepare a piece of your choice of similar length and perform it for us.

**The date for the wind auditions for spring 2026 will be announced at a later date.**
