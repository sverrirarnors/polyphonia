# Join Polyphonia Zürich

We are always looking for talented musicians to join our orchestra!

## Current Openings

We welcome applications from students and staff of ETH Zürich and the University of Zürich.

Currently, we are looking for musicians in the following sections:
- Strings (violin, viola, cello, double bass)
- Woodwinds (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon)
- Brass (horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba)
- Percussion

## Audition Process

### For Strings
Auditions typically take the form of a quartet evening. Together with the section leaders of the orchestra, you'll play excerpts from a previous program. This allows you to get a feel for playing together in the orchestra and get to know us.

### For Wind and Brass
You'll be invited to join us for a rehearsal where you'll play alongside the section. This gives you an opportunity to experience our rehearsal atmosphere and musical standards.

## Requirements

- Currently enrolled as a student or employed as staff at ETH Zürich or University of Zürich
- Proficiency on your instrument (we play advanced symphonic repertoire)
- Commitment to attend weekly rehearsals (Wednesdays, 18:00-21:00)
- Enthusiasm for orchestral music and collaborative music-making

Please send an email to [besetzung@polyphonia.ch](mailto:besetzung@polyphonia.ch) with:
- Your name and instrument
- Your university affiliation (ETH/UZH, program of study)
- Brief description of your musical background

We look forward to hearing from you!
