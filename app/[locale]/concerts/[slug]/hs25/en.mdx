# Autumn Semester 2025 Concert

Join us for our autumn concert featuring works by Borodin, Bruch, and Kalinnikov.

## Program

### Polovtsian Dances
**Alexander Porfirjewitsch Borodin**

The Polovtsian Dances, from Borodin's opera "Prince Igor," are among the most celebrated pieces of Russian classical music. These exotic and colorful dances capture the spirit of the nomadic Polovtsian people.

### Kol Nidrei, Op. 47
**Max Bruch**

This deeply moving work for cello and orchestra is based on the Jewish prayer Kol Nidrei. Bruch's setting showcases the cello's expressive range while weaving together traditional melodies with romantic orchestration.

### Symphony No. 1 in G minor
**Wassili Kalinnikow**

Kalinnikov's First Symphony is a masterwork of late Russian Romanticism. The symphony is full of sweeping melodies and rich orchestral colors, demonstrating the composer's gift for memorable themes and masterful orchestration.
