## <span id="orchestra">The Orchestra</span>

The Universitätsorchester Polyphonia Zürich is a symphonic university orchestra composed of students and staff from ETH Zürich and the University of Zürich.

### Our Mission

We prepare works from the classical orchestral repertoire each semester during the lecture period and perform them at the end of the semester in our concerts.

Since our founding, we have combined the joy of making music together with the aspiration to prepare classical orchestral works in a musically convincing manner. Our approximately sixty orchestra members study diverse fields at all levels, from Bachelor to Doctorate. We also have numerous international students in our ranks, and fostering exchange is very important to us.

### Rehearsals

We rehearse during the semester in English, every Wednesday from 18:00 to 21:00.

Location details and the exact rehearsal schedule can be found on our website.
